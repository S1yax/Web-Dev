            <li id="Lake">Lake Kaindy</li>
            <p class="description">Lake Kaindy was formed as a result of an earthquake in 1911. The natural disaster caused a large landslide that blocked the gorge, forming a natural dam. Water from nearby rivers and springs filled the gorge, creating a beautiful lake. A unique feature of the lake is the presence of submerged spruce trees at its bottom, which still stand upright, their tops protruding above the water's surface.</p>
